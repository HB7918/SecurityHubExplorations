# Security Hub Workflow Block Diagram

## Overview
Create a visual block diagram that represents the AWS Security Hub workflow from setup through tracking and reporting.

## User Stories

### 1. Visualize Security Hub Workflow
As a security engineer, I want to see a clear visual representation of the Security Hub workflow so that I can understand the complete process from setup to remediation.

### 2. Understand Process Flow
As a team member, I want to see how different stages connect so that I can identify where manual work occurs and where automation gaps exist.

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1.1 Diagram Structure
- The diagram must show 5 main stages: Getting Started & Setup, Discovery & Visibility, Triage & Investigation, Remediation, and Tracking & Reporting
- Each stage must be clearly labeled and visually distinct
- The flow between stages must be indicated with arrows or connectors

### 1.2 Stage Details
- Each stage must list its key activities as sub-items
- Activities must be presented in a logical order
- The diagram must highlight manual vs automated steps where relevant

### 1.3 Visual Clarity
- The diagram must use a consistent visual style
- Text must be readable and not overcrowded
- The overall flow must be easy to follow from left to right or top to bottom

### 1.4 Format
- The diagram should be created using Mermaid syntax for easy rendering
- The diagram should be saved as a markdown file with embedded Mermaid code
- Alternative formats (SVG, PNG) can be generated if needed

## Technical Requirements

- Use Mermaid.js for diagram creation
- Support markdown rendering
- Ensure compatibility with common documentation platforms

## Out of Scope

- Interactive diagram features
- Real-time data integration
- Detailed AWS service architecture
